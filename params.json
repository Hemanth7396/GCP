The data is spread across four files. The description of each file along with their location is listed below:\r\n\r\n\r\n**1. Streaming Tweet File** [(Download)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/credbank/stream_tweets_byTimestamp.data)\r\n\r\nThis file contains -- tweets seggregated around the timestamp when these were collected. Each line in the file contains 3 fields:\r\n\r\n```timespan_key``` : Date and time around which tweets were collected. For example, ```time_key = 20150114_044623-20150114_061420``` corresponds to streaming tweets from 14-Jan-2015 (--) to 14-Jan2015 (--).\r\n\r\n```tweet_count``` : Number of tweets in that time bin\r\n\r\n```ListOf_tweetid_author_createdAt_tuple``` : A list of tuples, where each tuple contains three fields: ```tweet ID``` , ```tweet author``` , ```tweet creation date```  \r\n\r\n```\r\ntimespan_key\t\ttweet_count\t\tListOf_tweetid_author_createdAt_tuple \r\n20150114_044623-20150114_061420\t92255\t[('555299882668670977', 'ZaE_BeAtZBsM808', 'Wed Jan 14 09:46:23 +0000 2015'), ('555299882698035203', 'gothebroncos', 'Wed Jan 14 09:46:23 +0000 2015'),....]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2.
